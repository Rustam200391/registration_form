# To launch the application after cloning the repository, you need to install the dependencies 

1. Registration page (as on any website)
2. Prescribe the logic of entering the phone number (so that when you try to enter 8 and 7, the digit changes to +7, so that the number is automatically registered in the back and separated by the "-" sign example: +7(999) 999-99-99
3. Stylize (to your taste), you can take templates from the Internet for layout
4. Make animations when you click on inputs and buttons, if there is an error about invalid data
5. You can implement saving via localstorage
